raven: clojure sentry client library
====================================

A Clojure library to send events to a sentry host.


### Usage

```clojure
[[spootnik/raven "0.1.4"]]
```

The main exported function is `capture!` and has two arities:

- `(capture! dsn event)`: Send a capture over the network, see the description of DSN and ev below.
- `(capture! context dsn event)`: Send a capture passing additional context, such as a specific HTTP client.

#### Arguments

- **DSN**: A Sentry DSN as defined http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/2.9.0/client/index.html#parsing-the-dsn
- **Event**: Either an exception or a map.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Context**: A map of additional information you can pass to Sentry. Note
=======
- **Context**: A map of aditional informations you can pass to Sentry. Note
>>>>>>> Add support for explicit context.
  that omitting this parameter will make use of some thread-local storage for
  some of the functionality.

#### Passing your own http instance

In many cases, it makes sense to reuse an already existing http client (created
with http/build-client). Raven will reuse an http instance if it is passed to
the (capture!) function through the `context` parameter, as :http.

```clojure
(capture! {:http (http/build-client {})} "<dsn>" "My message")
```

#### Breadcrumbs

Adding sentry "breadcrumbs" can be done using the `add-breadcrumb!` function,
that has the following arities:

- `(add-breadcrumb! breadcrumb)` Store a breadcrumb in thread-local storage.
- `(add-breadcrumb! context breadcrumb)` Store a breadcrumb in a user-specified
context. Context is expected to be map-like.

Well-formatted breadcrumb maps can be created with the `make-breadcrumb!`
helper, with the following arities:

- `(make-breadcrumb! message category)` A breadcrumb will be created with the
  "info" level.
- `(make-breadcrumb! message category level)` This allows specifying a level.
  Levels can be one of: 'debug' 'info' 'warning' 'warn' 'error' 'exception' 'critical' 'fatal'
- `(make-breadcrumb! message category level timestamp)` This allows setting a
  custom timestamp instead of letting the helper get one for you. Timestamp
  must be a floating point representation of **seconds** elapsed since the
  epoch (not milliseconds).

More information can be found on [Sentry's documentation website](https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/interfaces/breadcrumbs/)

#### Full example

```clojure
(def dsn "https://098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6:ad0234829205b9033196ba818f7a872b@sentry.example.com/42")
(add-breadcrumb! (make-breadcrumb! "The user did something" "com.example.Foo"))
(add-breadcrumb! (make-breadcrumb! "The user did something wrong" "com.example.Foo" "error"))
(capture! dsn (Exception.))
```
